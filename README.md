# CNAND-3DS
3DMenu-CNAND is a project that is in development and tries to fully emulate the firmware and applets of the N3DS on citra emulator. The proyect is currently in beta and there will be bugs and multiple errors.

The prototype of this first version is a homebrew app which can load some of the applets of the 3DS.

To use this app you need:

Citra emulator, devkitPro and the decrypted firmware of a 3DS, preferably the version 9.2 or 11.13, in the USA version, you can get all the .cia of the firmware in some internet websites, as https://darthsternie.net/3ds-firmwares/, but you will need a real 3DS with godmode9 to decrypt all the data, after that you can install all in citra and run the compiled app.
